# Arch Pilot - SaaS Architecture Recommendation Platform ## Project Overview Create a SaaS application called "Arch Pilot" that recommends software architecture and technology stacks based on user requirements, team skills, and project constraints. The app uses a short questionnaire approach with options-based UX for better user experience. ## Technology Stack ### Backend - **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API - **Pattern**: CQRS with MediatR - **Database**: PostgreSQL - **ORM**: Entity Framework Core 8 - **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT - **Caching**: Redis - **Logging**: Serilog with structured logging - **Validation**: FluentValidation - **Mapping**: AutoMapper ### Frontend - **Framework**: Blazor WebAssembly .NET 8 - **UI Library**: MudBlazor (mobile-responsive) - **State Management**: Fluxor - **PWA**: Enable PWA support for mobile ### Architecture - Clean Architecture (API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure layers) - Multi-tenant SaaS architecture - Docker containerization ready ## Core Features to Implement ### 1. Question Flow System Create a wizard-style questionnaire with these questions (all option-based): **Core Questions:** 1. **Project Type** (Single select) - Web Application, Mobile App, Desktop Application, API/Microservice, Data Pipeline, IoT Solution 2. **Project Scale** (Single select) - Personal/Side Project, Small Team (2-5), Medium Project (5-20), Enterprise (20+) 3. **Expected Users** (Single select) - < 100, 100-1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K+ 4. **Performance Priority** (Single select) - Speed is critical, Balanced performance, Cost over performance, Don't know 5. **Team Experience** (Multi-select) - .NET/C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, Cloud (AWS/Azure), Database design, New to development 6. **Timeline** (Single select) - ASAP (< 1 month), Short term (1-3 months), Medium term (3-6 months), Long term (6+ months) 7. **Budget Range** (Single select) - Bootstrap/Free tools only, Small budget (< $500/month), Medium budget ($500-2K/month), Enterprise budget (2K+/month) 8. **Regional Compliance** (Single select) - North America (CCPA, SOC2), European Union (GDPR), Asia-Pacific, Global/Multi-region, No specific requirements **"What If" Scenarios:** 9. **Traffic Spikes** - "What if you get 10x traffic overnight?" 10. **Team Growth** - "What if your team doubles in 6 months?" 11. **Data Sensitivity** - "What if you handle sensitive user data?" 12. **Integration Needs** - "What if you need to integrate with 3rd party APIs?" ### 2. Recommendation Engine - Rule-based recommendation system - Consider all question responses to suggest: - Architecture patterns (Monolithic, Microservices, Serverless, etc.) - Technology stacks - Infrastructure recommendations - Compliance considerations based on region ### 3. Results Display - Clear architecture recommendations with justifications - Technology stack suggestions - Implementation roadmap - Trade-offs and alternatives - Regional compliance notes ## Project Structure Requirements ### Backend Structure ``` src/ ├── Presentation/ │ └── ArchPilot.API/ ├── Application/ │ └── ArchPilot.Application/ ├── Domain/ │ └── ArchPilot.Domain/ └── Infrastructure/ ├── ArchPilot.Infrastructure/ └── ArchPilot.Persistence/ ``` ### Frontend Structure ``` src/ └── Presentation/ └── ArchPilot.BlazorWasm/ ``` ## Key Domain Models Needed ### Core Entities - `ProjectRequirements` - Captures all questionnaire responses - `TeamProfile` - Team skills and experience - `ArchitectureRecommendation` - Generated recommendations - `TechnologyStack` - Available tech stacks - `ComplianceRequirement` - Regional compliance rules - `User` - SaaS user management - `Tenant` - Multi-tenancy support ## Implementation Instructions 1. **Start with the backend API project** using Clean Architecture 2. **Set up the database** with EF Core and initial migrations 3. **Implement the questionnaire models** and validation 4. **Create the recommendation engine** with basic rule-based logic 5. **Set up the Blazor WebAssembly project** with MudBlazor 6. **Create the wizard UI components** for the questionnaire 7. **Implement state management** with Fluxor 8. **Add authentication and multi-tenancy** 9. **Style for mobile responsiveness** 10. **Add PWA capabilities** ## Additional Requirements - Use dependency injection throughout - Implement proper error handling and logging - Add unit tests for the recommendation engine - Include Swagger/OpenAPI documentation - Make it production-ready with proper configuration management - Include Docker files for containerization ## Getting Started 1. Create the solution structure with all projects 2. Set up the database connection and initial EF Core setup 3. Implement the basic CQRS pattern with MediatR 4. Create the questionnaire flow in Blazor with MudBlazor components 5. Build the recommendation engine logic Focus on creating a clean, maintainable codebase that can scale as a SaaS product. Prioritize the user experience with smooth questionnaire flow and clear, actionable recommendations.
